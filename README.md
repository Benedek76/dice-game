Game rules:

- The game is 2-player and turn-based.
- Each turn, the current player rolls the dice as many times as they want. The results of the rolls are added to the player's score for that turn, which starts at zero in each round.
- If the current player rolls a 1, all their accumulated points are lost, and the right to roll passes to the next player.
- The player can also choose the 'Keep' button. In this case, the points earned in the current turn are added to the player's total score. Then, it becomes the other player's turn to roll.
- The player who first reaches 100 points wins.
